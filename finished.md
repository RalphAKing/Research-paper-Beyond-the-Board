# Chapter 1 Regurgitation vs Reconstitution

## Regurgitation 

Regurgitation refers to the process where teachers (and by extension, students) simply repeat information without engaging with its meaning or context. This usually shows itself as teachers reading directly from the board or textbook and expecting the students to be able to memorize and or reproduce similar or the same context verbatim. The focus is on [Rote_learning](#ref-Rote_learning), where the primary goal is the accurate recall of facts, definitions or procedures rather than the genuine understanding.

### Example
A teacher is going through a powerpoint and reads a definition off of it out loud, and expects students to copy it into there notebooks and memorize it for a test, with little to no discussion about what the definition means, why it matters, its context or how it relates to other concepts.

### Implications
While regurgitation can be useful for memorizing the basic facts however, it often leads to superficial learning. Students may be able to recall information in the short term but struggle to apply it in new contexts or to think critically about the subject matter.
